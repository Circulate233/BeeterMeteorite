# BeeterMeteorite (1.12)

## About
This mod attempts to modify the meteorite generation mechanics in [AE2UEL](https://github.com/AE2-UEL/Applied-Energistics-2) by replacing the "sky stone chest" block with other block types and expanding the Meteorite Compass's functionality to point to additional block types.

You can modify these settings in the configuration file. By default, it will generate the "Mysterious Cube" which is ported from AE2 for Minecraft 1.18+.Textures and Models are from [AE2](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2?tab=readme-ov-file#license)

If you want to include this mod in a modpack, please do. I would be delighted to hear about it.
